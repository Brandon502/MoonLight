## Functional

* On: lights on or off
* Brightness: brightness of the LEDs when on
* driverOn: sends LED output to ESP32 gpio pins.
    * Switch off to see the effect framerate in System Status/Metrics
    * Switch on to see the effect framerate throttled by a LED driver in System Status/Metrics (800KHz, 256 leds, 24 bits is 130 fps theoretically - 120 practically)
* Pin: Currently only 2 and 16 supported
* Nodes: One or more processes, can be fixture definitions, mappings, effects, projections. Currently all nodes are effects.
    * Nodes can have arguments
* Scrips: Running Live scripts (WIP)
* If a script file is updated (here or in the [File Manager](https://ewowi.github.io/MoonBase/moonbase/files/)) and the file is part of an active node, it will rerun

## Technical

* See [Modules](../modules.md)
* Upon changing a pin, FastLED.addLeds will rerun
* Uses ESPLiveScripts, see compileAndRun. compileAndRun is started when in Nodes a file.sc animation is choosen
    * To do: kill running scripts, e.g. when changing effects
* To do: use Nodes arguments as arguments to scripts or hardcoded effects

### Mapping model (to do)

* Multiple Nodes can be created (1)
    * Each node can have properties (compare controls in WLED / StarLight)
    * Each node can run precompile code or Live scripts (with or without loop)
    * Each node has a type:
        * Fixture definition: tell where each pixture is in a 1D/2D/3D physical coordinate space (based on StarLight)
        * Fixture mapping: change the fixture to a 1D/2D/3D virtual coordinate space
            * A fixture mapping is for a specific fixture dimension and effect dimension
            * e.g. if the fixture is a globe, you can map that to 2D using mercator projection mapping
            * if the fixture is 200x200 you can map it to 50x50
            * if the fixture is 2D, a 1D effect can be shown as a circle or a bar (as WLED expand1D)
        * Effect: run an effect in a virtual coordinate space
            * or in the physical space if you want to run at highest performance, e.g. a random effect doesn't need to go through mappings ✅
        * Modifier: Mirror, rotate, etc, multiple projections allowed (projection in StarLight)
        * Driver show: show the result on Leds (using FastLED, hpwit drivers), ArtNet, DDP, ...
* Future situation: Nodes and noodles (2)
    * Replace the nodes table (1) by a graphical view (2)
* MappingTable (3)
    * Array of arrays. Outer array is virtual pixels, inner array is physical pixels. 
    * Implemented efficiently using the StarLight PhysMap struct
    * e.g. [[],[0],[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]]
        * first virtual pixel is not mapped to a physical pixel
        * second virtual pixel is mapped to physical pixel 0
        * third virtual pixel is mapped to physical pixels 1 and 2
        * and so on
    * CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS] are physical pixels (as in FASTLED)
    * Virtual pixels can be 1D, 2D or 3D. Physical pixels also, in any combination
        * Using x + y * sizeX + z * sizeX * sizeY
    * Each effect Node has it's own MappingTable and gets updated if fixture, mapping or dimensions change
    * set/getPixelColor functions used in effects using the MappingTable
    * Nodes manipulate the MappingTable and/or interfere in the effects loop
* Presets/playlist: change (part of) the nodes model

✅: Done
