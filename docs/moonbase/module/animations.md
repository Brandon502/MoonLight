## Functional

* Nodes: One or more processes, 
    * Can be light layouts, effects or modifiers (in fact one node can also be a combination of these)
    * On/off button defines if a node is active or not
    * Nodes define their own controls
    * A node can be a precompiled Node or a livescript (loaded in the file system)
* If a live script file is updated (here or in the [File Manager](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/files/)) and the file is part of an active node, it will recompile

## Technical

* See [Modules](../modules.md)
* Upon changing a pin, FastLED.addLeds will rerun
* Uses ESPLiveScripts, see compileAndRun. compileAndRun is started when in Nodes a file.sc animation is choosen
    * To do: kill running scripts, e.g. when changing effects
* To do: use Nodes arguments as arguments to scripts or hardcoded effects

### Mapping model (WIP)

* Multiple Nodes can be created (1)
    * Each node can have controls (compare controls in WLED / StarLight) âœ…
    * Each node can run precompile code or Live scripts (with or without loop) âœ…
    * Each node has a type:
        * Layout: tell where each light is in a 1D/2D/3D physical coordinate space (based on StarLight fixtures) âœ…
        * Effect: 
            * run an effect in a virtual coordinate space âœ…
            * in the physical space if you want to run at highest performance, e.g. a random effect doesn't need to go through mappings âœ…
        * Modifier: Mirror, rotate, etc, multiple modfiers allowed (projection in StarLight) ðŸš§
            * A modifier can also map lights dimensions to effect dimensions: change the lights to a 1D/2D/3D virtual coordinate space
                * e.g. if the light is a globe, you can map that to 2D using mercator projection mapping
                * if the light is 200x200 you can map it to 50x50
                * if the light is 2D, a 1D effect can be shown as a circle or a bar (as WLED expand1D)
        * Driver show: show the result on Leds (using FastLED, hpwit drivers), ArtNet, DDP, ...
* Future situation: Nodes and noodles (2)
    * Replace the nodes table (1) by a graphical view (2)
* Virtual Layer (MappingTable) (3)
    * Array of arrays. Outer array is virtual lights, inner array is physical lights. âœ…
    * Implemented efficiently using the StarLight PhysMap struct âœ…
    * e.g. [[],[0],[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]] âœ…
        * first virtual light is not mapped to a physical light
        * second virtual light is mapped to physical light 0
        * third virtual light is mapped to physical lights 1 and 2
        * and so on
    * Virtual lights can be 1D, 2D or 3D. Physical lights also, in any combination
        * Using x + y * sizeX + z * sizeX * sizeY ðŸš§
    * set/getLightColor functions used in effects using the MappingTable âœ…
    * Nodes manipulate the MappingTable and/or interfere in the effects loop ðŸš§
    * A Virtual Layer mapping gets updated if a layout, mapping or dimensions change ðŸš§
    * An effect uses a virtual layer. One Virtual layer can have multiple effects. âœ…
* Physical layer
    * CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS] are physical lights (as in FASTLED) âœ…
    * A Physical layer has one or more virtual layers and a virtual layer has one or more effects using it. âœ…
* Presets/playlist: change (part of) the nodes model

âœ…: Done
