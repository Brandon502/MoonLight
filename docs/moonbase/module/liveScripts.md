## Functional

MoonLight is based on nodes (see animations) where each node can run precompiled layouts, effects or modifiers but alternatively, each node can also run a live script, uploaded on the esp32 file system (.sc files).
Currently this only works on esp32-S3 boards as normal esp32 boards do not have enough memory to flash MoonLight with the Live Scripts option.

This module shows all running live scripts

* Scrips: Running Live scripts (WIP)
* Press the edit button to stop start or kill a script (current bug: double click the button)

### Scripts

Example scripts can be found in [Live scripts](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/tree/main/misc/livescripts) - WIP

They represent current state of Live Script processing and will be extended as more functionality will be added.

## Technical

* See [Modules](../modules.md)
* Uses ESPLiveScripts, see compileAndRun. compileAndRun is started when in Nodes a file.sc animation is choosen
    * To do: kill running scripts, e.g. when changing effects
