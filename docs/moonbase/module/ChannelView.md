## Functional

Shows each channel within the light array. e.g. for a LED strip or panel each light is 3 (or 4 in case of RGBW) channels. For multichannel lights like Moving heads.
If you hover over a channel, that channel will output a value - by this you can reverse engineer positions of existing lights, e.g. when you output to an unknown DMX setup.

This is WIP - currenly only the buttons are shown.
