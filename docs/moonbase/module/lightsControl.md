## Functional

* On: lights on or off
* Brightness: brightness of the LEDs when on
* RGB Sliders: control each color seperately.
* Presets: Control pad style, store or retrieve a set of nodes with their controls. WIP
* driverOn: sends LED output to ESP32 gpio pins.
    * Switch off to see the effect framerate in System Status/Metrics
    * Switch on to see the effect framerate throttled by a LED driver in System Status/Metrics (800KHz, 256 leds, 24 bits is 130 fps theoretically - 120 practically)
* Pin: Currently only 2 and 16 supported: todo: move to lights layout nodes

## Technical

Controls is the interface to control lights for the UI, but also for all protocols eg. HA, DMX, etc
e.g. a DMX controller, can control presets, but not individual preset details.
