# MoonLight Installation

Install Moonlight onto an ESP32 using the MoonLight Web installer

* **Step 1**: Get an **ESP32 or ESP32-S3** (preferred, support large setups and Live Scripts). Boards we use are [ESP32](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EyrmQyw) or [ESP32-S3](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBAtJ2H), but most of the ESP32 and ESP32-S3 boards will work. Get a **WS2812 LED-strip** or a [LED-panel](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EGx8Hhu) (preferred to see 2D effects). Connect the strip or panel to the board on a suitable pin (e.g. Pin 2 or 16).

* **Step 2**: Connect an ESP32 via USB

* **Step 3**: Go to the web installer: [MoonLight Web Installer](https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/index.html). The Web Installer works on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge or similar browsers, not on Safari. Select your board, or if not listed, press others.

* **Step 5**: Choose to **erase** the board first or not. Erase if you have a new board or want to start fresh. Do not erase if you want to update an existing MoonLight installation. Erase deletes all settings and requires to re-connect to WiFi.

* **Step 11**: Press **Add Network** and apply settings. After connecting to your normal WiFi network you will see this screen showing the new IP address of your MoonLight board. You need the IP address to connect to tge board. If you don't know the IP address of your board anymore you can go to step 3 and 4 and step 7 and check the IP address in the Serial logging. Advanced tip: Use [ESP32Devices](https://github.com/ewowi/ESP32Devices) to discover the ESP32 nodes on your network (using nodeJS and html)
