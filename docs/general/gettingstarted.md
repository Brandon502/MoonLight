* Open the folder created with GitKraken
* Connect an ESP32 or an ESP32-S3 with USB to your computer
* On the status bar select the env to flash and the board to flash to
    * Select esp32dev for a normal ESP32
    * Select esp32-s3-devkitc-1-n16r8v for an ESP32-S2 ([recommended](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBAtJ2H) or similar)

## Installation - End user

[install](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase/blob/main/docs/general/index.html)

* release 0.5.4, for latest build follow installation developer
* This is WIP, looks like issue with erasing the board and setting the partitions right ...
* Made using [esp-web-tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/)

## Configuration

* In case of a newly flashed board, a Wifi access point (AP) will be created. Go to your Wifi settings on your computer and find the new Wifi AP (starts with MoonBase, MoonLight or ESPSvelteKit)
    * If the board AP is not showing up in your WiFi list it might be helpful to fully erase the board before flashing (vscode ðŸ‘½, Erase flash)
* Connect to the AP (no password needed), a captive portal will show with a welcome screen.
    * There seems to be an issue in the captive portal showing Connection to device lost repeatedly. In that case, close the captive portal and open the app in a brower using 192.168.4.1
* Go to the menu and select Wifi / Wifi Station
* Press (+) and enter the SSID and the password of your Wifi Network
* Press Add Network and Apply settings
* The board will reconnect to your Wifi Network
* Go back to your Wifi Network on your computer
* Find out the new IP of the board, or in your Wifi Network settings or by looking at the log in the Serial Monitor (see above)
* (sometimes it takes a while to load pages for the first time, might be related to caching of javascript, on the issuelist)

## Developing

* Read the [ESP32 Sveltekit docs](https://ewowi.github.io/MoonBase/esp32sveltekit/)
* Read [Customizing Sveltekit](https://ewowi.github.io/MoonBase/general/customizingsveltekit/)
* UI dev: configure vite.config.ts, go to interface folder, npm install, npm run dev. A local webserver starts on localhost. UI changes will directly be shown via this webserver
* Changes made to the UI are not always visible in the browser, issue with caching / max-age (WIP), clear the browser cache to see latest UI.
* Want to make changes: fork the repo and submit pull requests, see [creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork):
    * Login to your own github account
    * Fork: go to [ewowi/MoonBase](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase/) and press Fork, uncheck 'Copy the main branch only' and press Create Fork. You will be moved to your fork of MoonBase
    * Press xx Branches, press New Branch, give it a name e.g. background-script and press Create new Branch, click on background-script

    * Go to the file you want to change e.g. [ModuleAnimations.h](https://github.com/ewoudwijma/MoonBase/blob/background-script/src/custom/ModuleAnimations.h), press edit and make the changes. E.g. change executable.execute("main") to executable.executeAsTask("main")

    * The upstream repo can now process this PR

## MoonBase specific

* Connect a 256 leds panel to the board
* Search for FastLED.addLeds in the code and update to the pin you use to drive LEDS, reflash the code to the board
* Go to the UI in the browser
* Go to Custom / Files and create or upload Live scripts 
* Go to Custom / Module Animations and select the 'hardcoded animations' (Random, Sinelon, Rainbow), you should see it on your panel
* Select any of the Live scripts you uploaded, check the Serial Output for results. (No led output in current version, see below)
* Open the Edit area and change things in the code, see the Serial Output for results

* To do
    * Find a way to present feedback to the UI (e.g. error messages as comments in the sc file)
    * Extend the code in [ModuleAnimations.h](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase/blob/main/src/custom/ModuleAnimations.h) to support led animations ('homework assignment')
    * see ModuleAnimation.h (Server)

### Current script supported

```cpp
void setup() {
  printf("Run Live Script good afternoon\n");
}
void main() {
  setup();
}
```

### Homework assignment

```cpp
void setup() {
  printf("Run Live Script good morning\n");
}
void loop() {
  fadeToBlackBy(40);
  leds[random16(255)] = CRGB(0, 0, 255);
}
void main() {
  setup();
  while (true) {
    loop();
    sync(); //or show??
  }
}
```
