## Installation - End user

WIP...

[install](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase/blob/main/docs/general/index.html)

* release 0.5.4, for latest build follow installation developer
* This is WIP, looks like issue with erasing the board and setting the partitions right ...
* Made using [esp-web-tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/)

## Configuration

* In case of a newly flashed board, a Wifi access point (AP) will be created. Go to your Wifi settings on your computer and find the new Wifi AP (starts with MoonBase, MoonLight or ESPSvelteKit)
    * If the board AP is not showing up in your WiFi list it might be helpful to fully erase the board before flashing (vscode ðŸ‘½, Erase flash)
* Connect to the AP (no password needed), a captive portal will show with a welcome screen.
    * There seems to be an issue in the captive portal showing Connection to device lost repeatedly. In that case, close the captive portal and open the app in a brower using 192.168.4.1
* Go to the menu and select Wifi / Wifi Station
* Press (+) and enter the SSID and the password of your Wifi Network
* Press Add Network and Apply settings
* The board will reconnect to your Wifi Network
* Go back to your Wifi Network on your computer
* Find out the new IP of the board
    * New: Use [ESP32Instances](https://github.com/ewowi/ESP32Instances) to discover the ESP32 nodes on your network (using nodeJS and html)
    * Alternatively, find the IP by checking your router or by looking at the log in the Serial Monitor (see above)
* (sometimes it takes a while to load pages for the first time, might be related to caching of javascript, on the issuelist)

## MoonBase specific

At the moment MoonBase is the work in progress repo and temporary also contains LED functionality (MoonLight / Animations), will move later to the MoonLight repo.

* Connect a 256 leds panel to the board on Pin 2 or 16

* Go to the UI in the browser
* Go to MoonLight / Animations
    * Select Pin 2 or 16
    * Create a node, select the 'hardcoded animations' (Random, Sinelon, Rainbow, Sinus), you should see it on your panel
    * Create more nodes with other animations, they will all run at the same time 
* Live Scripts: Go to MoonBase / Files and create or upload Live scripts.
    * Examples: [Live scripts](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase/tree/main/misc/livescripts)
    * Back to Animations, select any of the Live scripts you uploaded, check the Led Panel and / or Serial Output for results
    * Open the Edit area and change things in the code, see the Serial Output for results

## Developing

* Read the [ESP32 Sveltekit docs](https://ewowi.github.io/MoonBase/esp32sveltekit/)
* Read [Customizing Sveltekit](https://ewowi.github.io/MoonBase/general/customizingsveltekit/)
* Instead of cloning the repo directly from the MoonBase or MoonLight as described above, create a fork first so you have your own environment to make changes to. See also Pull Requests below.
* UI dev: configure vite.config.ts, go to interface folder, npm install, npm run dev. A local webserver starts on localhost. UI changes will directly be shown via this webserver
* Changes made to the UI are not always visible in the browser, issue with caching / max-age (WIP), clear the browser cache to see latest UI.

## Pull Requests

* Want to make changes: fork the repo and submit pull requests, see [creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork):

    * Login to your own github account
    * Fork: go to [ewowi/MoonBase](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase/) and press Fork, uncheck 'Copy the main branch only' and press Create Fork. You will be moved to your fork of MoonBase
    * Press Branches, press New Branch, give it a name e.g. background-script and press Create new Branch, click on background-script
